        /*Coding Challenge #4
        Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a
        restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and
        300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
        Your tasks:
        1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for
        this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement  (If it's easier for you, you can
        start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary
        operator!)
        2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value
        (bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value
        316.25”
        Test data:
        § Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
        Hints:
        § To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
        § Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300
        */
        //1
        const calcTip = function (bill) {
            return bill >= 50 && bill < 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;
        }
        bills = [275, 40, 430];
        tips = [calcTip(bills[0]), calcTip(bills[1]), calcTip(bills[2])];
        totals = [bills[0] + tips[0], bills[1] + tips[1], bills[2] + tips[2]];
        for (let index = 0; index < totals.length; index++) {
            console.log(`The bill was ${bills[index]}, the tip was ${tips[index]}, and the total value ${totals[index]}`);

        }
